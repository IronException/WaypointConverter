n: x y z (c) w n a
example: name: -61 68 28 (#05FC40)  0
to example: as you can see I didnt type a value for w. So you can leave values out if you want the standard value there but make sure to leave the seperators in there. Otherwise a mess with be outputed. You can also end before you have pasted every value but still keep the possible mess in mind.
name: n
x coordinate: x
y coordinate: y
z coordinate: z
owerworld coordinates: w
to w: Type 1 for overworld coordinates. Otherwise say 0 for end or nether. So the programm knows wether it has to convert the coordinates for journey map
red: r
green: g
blue: b
color value: c
to c: The color value is saved as r g b seperatly in journey map but you can also input hex values with c in my program.
enable: a
overworld dimension: o
nether dimension: n
end dimension: e
origin: h
icon: i
persistent: p
to o, n, p: either type 1 if the waypoint shall be for that dimension or 0 if it sholdnt.
to 1 and 0: You can also use True or true for 1 and False and false for 0. Otherwise it will every be false
note: if you dont know what to do with variables better dont touch them. I left the variables out in the standart format that you probably dont need and that I dont know a way of changing in game.
